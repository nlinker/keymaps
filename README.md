# Nick's layout

Derived from configuration in 
[Oryx](https://configure.zsa.io/moonlander/layouts/gqXJ4/latest/0)

This layout uses 56 keys only and fits to Iris rev4 keyboard.

The most notable features are:
- Colemak-DH on the base layer, Qwerty is possible
- Ctrl and Alt modifiers are on the bottom layers, Shift keys ars explicitly dedicated and never overloaded. 
  The usage of the dedicated Shift keys greatly reduces the number of errors
- Underscore is the default, `-` can be obtained either with Shift, or using Symbol layer 
- Buffer operations spans through all the layers, Ctrl+X is implemented as the chord (Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V)
- Navigation layer is accessible with the most ease and contains not only cursor moves, 
  but Fns, word selections, modifiers and other helpers
- Navigation layer modifier keys are _sticky_: left and right keys behave as usual modifiers, 
  but simultaneous press toggles to the layer. Any press of the modifiers toggles them back
- Symbol layer is accessible with home row pinkies hold, and is synchronized with the base layer; 
  this means the base symbols correspond to the shifted ones on the Symbol layer, it simplifies the layout remembering

- **TODO** shortcuts and symbols don't depend on the English/Russian system layout
